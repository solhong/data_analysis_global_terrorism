# Global Terrorism Analysis
---
## Purpose
> **Definition of Terrorism**  
> *"The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."*

Twenty years ago terrorists challenged the world's only remaining superpower. In response, the United States declared a "war on terror." The world continues to struggle with the consequences. The "war on terror" proclaimed by Bush became a liminal war. A war "that is not precisely defined, neither temporally nor geographically. It is being waged globally," as Johannes Thimm, a US expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs defines it. The "Cost of War" project of Brown University says the US government is carrying out anti-terror measures in a total of 85 countries. Their team calculated that in the "war on terror" a total of nearly 930,000 people have been killed directly as a result of combat operations, almost 400,000 of them civilians. This shows that terrorism resulted death of innocent citizens. To undertand the expansion of global terrorism, Exploratory Data Anlaysis is used.

Most victims of terrorism are innocent citizens who find themselves at the wrong place and at the wrong time, randomly targeted in brutal attacks. The lives of survivors of attacks, and those of victims’ families, are irreparably damaged. Many survivors take years to recover physically from their injuries or come to terms with their losses, and many remain deeply traumatized. With close partnership with governments, victims’ organizations and civil society groups, we should strengthen the implementation of national legislation and policies that support and protect victims of acts of terrorism.
